I moved to Berlin to get a better feeling of the tech spirit. I started at Schütze very soon after my relocation.
I worked mainly on very big enterprise applications with typescript, react and redux. We developed an ui libary and more. In addition that I maintained some old Java applications.

Technologies I used at Schütze:

- React
- Javascript
- Typescript
- Redux
- Jest
- Storybook
- yarn
- Java
- Maven
