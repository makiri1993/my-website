Karim, a cooperation with an other freelancer, and me reimplemented the design with a new stack. We used typescript, react and gatsby for a JAM-Stack site with netlifyCMS. The site is right now on the first page in google when looking for similiar companies in Hanover. The site is still under construction and will be developed every now and then to maintain the stack and use the newest features.

The site is GDPR-ready and blazing fast. Feel free to test it. :D
