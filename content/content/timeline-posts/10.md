Pop Rocket Labs is a digital agency based in Hamburg. They contacted me for a mobile web application running in a web view. 
The goal was to get a native feeling with web technologies. To achieve maximal performance there was a very intense phase to finetune every aspect of the application. A huge challenge was to implement an own routing animation since current libraries didn't provide the smoothness needed.

Technologies I used at Pop Rocket Labs:

- Typescript
- React
- Redux
- REST
