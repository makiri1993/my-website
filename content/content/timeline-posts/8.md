This was my first experience at a startup. I really liked the fast processes and the agile development. Here I definitely learned to extend my capabilities to the maximum and even more. I dived into some devops stuff and the possibilities with the new technologies like Kubernetes. I worked on every web topic from an enterprise web application to marketing tracking. Feel free to contact me for more detailed information.

I loved working at a fintech. Unfortunately I realized that I want to work more independent and on my own future. After TR I started to freelance in Berlin.

Technologies I used at TR:

- Vue
- Vuex
- Nuxt
- GraphQL
- Strapi
- NodeJS
- Typescript
- Javascript
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- MVVM -> Paradigm
- HandleBarsJS -> I'm really trying to avoid this one :D
