I started studying in Hildesheim near Hanover,Germany in 2013. During the courses I realized my passion for code. After some courses I focused mainly on programming. Unfortunately in university the course were pretty much deprecated and only interesting because it was the only possibility to get more in touch with coding. After some time I found out that Finanz Informatik is a partner of my university so I applied there as working student.

Programming languages I learned in university:

- Java
- JavaEE
- HTML
- CSS
- C++
