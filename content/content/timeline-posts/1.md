This was my first experience at a startup. I really liked the fast proceses and the agile development. Here I definetly learned to extend my capabilities to the maximum and even more. I learned some devops stuff and the possibilities with the new technologies. I worked on every web topic from an enterprise webapp to marketing tracking. Feel free to contact me for detailed information.

I loved working at a fintech. Unfortunately here I realized that I want to work more independent and on my own future. After TR i started to freelance in Berlin. But also worldwide of course.

Technologies I used at TR:

- Vue
- Vuex
- Nuxt
- GraphQL
- Strapi
- NodeJS
- Typescript
- Javascript
- HandleBarsJS
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- MVVM -> Paradigm
