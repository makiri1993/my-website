description: "Trade Republic is Germany's first mobile broker. I was working there as the only frontend engineer. It was a very challenging time because I implemented custom solutions for a blog, a help center and maintained at the same time the website and back-office for the internal usage of banking processes. The back-office was a full application with frontend and backend, both written in Typescript. In addition to that, I was in charge of the deployments in Kubernetes. I loved working at a fintech. Unfortunately, I realized that I want to do more independent and in my future. After TR I started to freelance in Berlin."
