description: "I started studying in Hildesheim near Hanover, Germany in 2013. During the courses I realized my passion for code. In university I focused mainly on programming. Unfortunately the courses were pretty much deprecated and only interesting because it was the only possibility to get more in touch with coding. After some time I found out that Finanz Informatik is a partner of my university so I applied there as a working student. Programming languages I learned in university:"
