summary: "My comeback to the enterprise world"
description: "mobile.de is a platform for classified advertisements for cars. In addition to the C2C market, it is also having an impressive base of partner car dealers. After my start-up projects, I wanted to work for a big company again. I got to know a lot of teams inside mobile.de and dug deeper into the benefits of central identity service and the mechanism of OAuth 2.0. The current team is migrating to the whole company."
