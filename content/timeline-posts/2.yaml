description: "ITP is a consulting company based in Berlin. They are mainly working on digitalization. I started there in a maintenance project for the Berlin Sparkasse, where I primarily worked on Linux machines and maintained several scripts. After that project, I worked on PoC for the Finanz Informatik. The project was a Java spring application with several banking processes to calculate a historical simulation. The next project started in August 2018. It was an enormous project to redesign the risk management application for all customers of the Finanz Informatik. I began to model all banking processes related to risk management, especially market risk and liquidity risk. In addition to that, I also implemented several PoCs for performance benchmarks with established software solutions. I also worked on the UI with the internal OSPlus framework. Besides that, I reviewed concepts and created designs for the new risk application."
